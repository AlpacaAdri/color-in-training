# 17: Node.js

Tips: `3`

This assignment reviews your Node.js knowledge!
You will make a folder called `YOUR-NAME`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

This will be an open project. Find at least 3 packages and make something of it.

**THIS IS ONE OF THE TIMES TO PUT MORE ELBOW GREASE THAN THE REST TO GAIN EXTRA TIPS**

## Option 2 *(+10 tips)*

You can make a Nodebot using [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/).

You will show it to me in person, with the code hosted on GitHub, in a new Repository.

I'm expecting something worth the 10 extra tips, so make it **cool**.
