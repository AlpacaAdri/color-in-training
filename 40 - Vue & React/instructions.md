# 40: Vue & React

Tip: `8`

You will make a file called `YOUR-NAME.md`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

In that file will be a link to a repo.

This repo will be an app with Vue or React and:

- Express
- Pug
- Stylus
- Good Documentation*
- CircleCI Unit Testing w/ Jest
- ðŸŽ‰ More

This will be a large part of success. A maximum of 10 extra credit points can be earned, depending on your app.

Your app will need to have a *beautiful* git tree.
