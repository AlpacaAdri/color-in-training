**You must complete up to #16 to compete**

## Rules:

You Get 2 Tips from Louis at the start, which you can spend whenever to ask questions and more. I'll judge how to answer and remove tips.

Each complete instruction will award a certain amount of tips.

You do **not** have to go in order

Repositories made and linked will be added as submodules.

You may ask others for help, but remember that *this is a competition*

The winner gets a **nice high five***. üëç
