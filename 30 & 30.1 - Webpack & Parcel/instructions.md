# 30 & 30.1: Webpack & Parcel

Tips: `4`

Prerequisites: `#3`, `#4`, `#5`

You will make a folder called `YOUR-NAME`, with `YOUR-NAME` replaced with your name.

You will use either Webpack or Parcel to compile your project from **#3**, **#4** and **#5**.

You will convert the HTML to Pug *(Or any other HTML Preprocessor, see #40 - Vue & React)*, CSS to Stylus *(see #40 - Vue & React)*, and (optionally) JS to TS.
